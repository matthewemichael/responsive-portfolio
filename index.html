      <p>Welcome! I am a student at Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp with aspirations of becoming a web devoper in the near future.  Currently, I work in the tv/film industry as a set dresser and carpenter. </p>

      <p>In previous lives I was an audio engineer and later owned a commercial wood shop that manufactured home furniture, retail displays and eventually props and set design elements. </p>

      <p>I love learning, problem solving and finding new ways to overcome the challenges that life presents.  I am looking forward to the remainder of this program and eventually a new career!     </p>
